# Gregory Hallenbeck, Ph.D.

I'm a lecturer and the senior coordinator of the [Digital & Data Studies](https://www.binghamton.edu/harpur/degrees/digital-data.html)
program at Binghamton University. We are a minor that grounds technology, primarily programming, data science, and the digital humanities, in the liberal art,
including questions of social justice, technology ethics, and critical data studies. We emphasize accessibility and inclusivity of technology.

My teaching has covered many topics over the years, including:
